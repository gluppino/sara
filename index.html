    <div class="bio">
        <p>Hello, I am Dr. Sara Thompson. I grew up in East Troy, Wisconsin, went to undergraduate at UW-LaCrosse, and 
            completed my veterinary education at Ross University. I have worked in small animal and emergency medicine 
            for the last several years in the Chicagoland and Milwaukee areas and have now moved back to the area I grew up.

            I find all areas of veterinary medicine rewarding, but have special interest in integrative medicine. 
            I have a certification in veterinary acupuncture and animal chiropractic, or VSMT. 
            
            In my free-time I enjoy getting outdoors with my husband, Garret, our children Adelyn, Oliver and Penelope, 
            our dogs, Ryver and Rutabaga, and our cats, Sherman, Lucille and Simon. I also enjoy gardening, cooking, 
            and working on renovating our new home! I look forward to meeting you and your companions soon!

        <p>Acupuncture is a method of treatment by which specific points on the body are stimulated. Methods of 
            stimulation include; pressure, needles, fluid, electrical current, and heat. The goal of acupuncture 
            is to restore the flow of energy throughout the body and help the body to become balanced once again 
            to restore health. 
             
            Acupuncture is a very safe medical procedure and a typical session lasts between 30-60 minutes. 
            Acupuncture has been proven to be very beneficial in reducing pain, regulating gastrointestinal motility, 
            decreasing inflammation, stimulating the immune system, aiding in hormone regulation, and promoting micro-circulation.

    <h2 class="chiro">Chiropractic</h2>
    
    <div class="crack">
        <p>Chiropractic, or spinal manipulation therapy (VSMT), is a manual therapy that looks for decreased motion 
            and restriction in the joints of the spine. These restrictions can cause a decrease in normal movement and 
            cause negative effects to the nervous system. During a chiropractic exam the joints in the body are taken 
            through a series of motions to identify restrictions and decreased range of motion (subluxations). 
            An adjustment is made through a very quick and concise movement and is very safe for the patient.
